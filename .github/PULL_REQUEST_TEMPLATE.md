# Before submitting a PR:
We love getting PRs, but we hate asking people for the same basic changes every time. 

- [ ] Push your changes to a branch other than `master`. 
- [ ] Add JavaDocs and other comments
- [ ] Write tests that run and pass in CI. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to capture snapshot data.  
- [ ] Run `mvn install` locally. This may reformat your code, commit those changes.
